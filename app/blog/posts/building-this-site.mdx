First things how about that image? I think I may continue to make these silly ones for a bit.

So why use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) when there are other options available? I like to stay in touch with what is out in the web dev world and Next has a pretty big piece of the pie. This allows me to go use other frameworks for other passion projects.

Another reason is AI is pretty good at react and next which makes it super easy for me to add features to my site using AI to save time. As I plan to use my site more to share my thoughts, travels, and projects having a AI junior dev that I can give tasks to takes away excuses.

I plan on adding more neat features to the site in the future. This is the current stack I am using:

<ul className="list-disc">
  <li>Next.js</li>
  <li>Cloudflare images</li>
  <li>S3</li>
</ul>

To wrap up I went with Next as the old saying if it ain't broke don't fix it.
